The truly transformative inventions and the entrepreneurial ideas that ended up having a significant impact, started relatively small.
Most people didn’t understand even what you were talking about. It would take some time before they got attention.
But eventually when they broke through, the impact was far broader than anybody could have imagined. 递进

If you prefer a morning run, do that instead. 解释

It cannot prove that A actually causes B. It could be that people with B are at a higher risk of A.
Future studies are needed to tease out the causality for the link. 因果

People sometimes may feel tired of the mundane, day-to-day life.
And to some extent, we always expect to make great fortune overnight. But life doesn't work that way.
Life is a marathon, not a sprint.
Before those great people became great people, they also lived a seemingly boring life, doing trivial things every day, but these things finally connected from dots to a line and made them.
Forrest Gump's life is the best proof of that.
His perseverance, undaunted spirit is a perpetual inspiration for me whenever I feel tired and lost.

Darkest Hour is a biographical film recounting Winston Churchill's political journey during the period of World War II.
It let me know that even such a psychologically strong man had vulnerable and self-doubt moments when suffering severe pains same as we did. 
However he never gave up and always hit back. 
Just as his well-known saying goes, success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts.
Churchill's undaunted spirit is a perpetual inspiration for me to overcome the difficulties and setbacks in my life.

Chinese dishes are very diverse. 
Different regions have different cuisines.
The south east including Guangdong province and Hong Kong is home to Cantonese cuisine. The flavor there tends to be salty and sweet. People there are good at making sweet barbecued meat. And because of its proximity to the seas, there's a lot of seafood. Cantonese cuisine also includes dim sums, such as rice noodle rolls, delicate shrimp dumplings wrapped in tapioca flour, etc.
West region such as Sichuan province is known for its spicy food. Signature dishes such as Mapo tofu, boiled fish and hot pot are quite popular across the country.
In northeastern China, dishes are usually very saucy, hearty and meaty. Servings in the restaurant are always large.
A highly recommended dish is Guobaorou, sweet and sour pork with special ingredients and cuisine, crispy and tender.
These are just the tip of the iceberg of Chinese cuisines. China is absolutely the paradise for foodies with endless list of dishes to try.

When Steve Jobs was young, he took a calligraphy class simply because he found it fascinating despite it seemed practically useless.
But 10 years later, when he was designing the first Macintosh computer, it paid off and brought the artistically subtle, beautiful typography.
It was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when he was in college, but it was very clear looking backwards ten years later. 
These dots somehow connected and made the difference.

Urban heat island is a phenomenon that an urban area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.
The heat capacity of the materials that constitute the city, which is typically dominated by concrete and asphalt, is relatively high, compared with the vegetative blanket in the surrounding countryside.
Heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored during the day and will be released at night.

Once a friend of mine bought a lipstick that she really liked and wore it to the school’s New Year Party. 
When we met at the gate, she was so excited and told me that she finally bought this lipstick and asked me if it looked good.
Honestly, her skin was very fair and this nude color made her look pale, even unhealthy. 
So I said I didn’t think the color suited her very well. 
She seemed very disappointed and frustrated and couldn’t stop looking into the mirror the entire evening and wasn’t able to enjoy the party at all.
When I think back, I feel sorry for being so straightforward about her question. I should have put it in a milder way.

A ticket seller scolded a woman who cut the queue twice at a railway station.
He refused to serve her unless she joined the queue.
Eventually, the woman queued up at his counter although there were other staff members selling tickets too.
Many praised the employee for standing up to the woman. He should be promoted to manager. There aren't many people like this. Most people would just let the matter rest.

A little boy was smitten by an airport guard dressed in uniform. He looked up to the guard with a longing gaze for a hug.
The guard looked around, hesitating whether to hug him while on patrol duty. He eventually gave the little boy a handshake.
But it wasn't enough for his little admirer. The boy continued to linger around, hoping for a hug.
Finally, the security guard gave the little boy a salute.

On the Shenzhen metro, a man scolded three construction workers for occupying seats on a train.
A witness took the video then came to their defense.
The man's behavior prompted other angry passengers to fight back until he finally left.
This video went viral on Chinese social media. Many applauded the girl who recorded this, because she spoke up. Without construction workers, how would you be able to take the metro? Despite building cities and massive infrastructure projects, construction workers are still sometimes seen as low-class.

# structure

Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist who coined the phrase “Panaramitee Style” suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art, 
in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style (outlines of figures and animals), 
followed by a range of complex figurative styles that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric tradition, tended to much greater regional diversity. 递进

While accepting that this sequence fits the archaeological profile of those sites, which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years, 
a number of writers have warned that the underlying assumption of such a sequence, a development from the simple and the geometric to the complex and naturalistic, 
obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal Australia, in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important. 解释

In the fourteenth century, a number of political developments cut Europe's overland trade routes to southern and eastern Asia, with which Europe had had important and highly profitable commercial ties since the twelfth century. 过去的过去
Widely reported, if somewhat distrusted, accounts by figures like the famous traveler from Venice, Marco Polo, of the willingness of people in China to trade with Europeans and of the immensity of the wealth to be gained by such contact made the idea irresistible. 虽有点不信但

Nor have merchants and artisans ever had much tolerance for aristocratic professions of moral superiority, favoring instead an egalitarian ethic of the opening market, where steady hard work, the loyalty of one’s fellows, and entrepreneurial skill make all difference. 倒装
Should the use of reward fail, members can frequently win by rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who deviated from the primary group’s norm. 虚拟
